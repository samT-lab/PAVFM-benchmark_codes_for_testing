# PAVFM-benchmark_codes_for_testing
this repository contains our 100 codes that we have tested on SonarLint.
We have used the SonarQube Plugin available on the Visual Studio Code to do a quality anaysis of our codes.
# SonarQube is a static analysis tool and it has the following features:
# DETECT BUGS
Can detect tricky bugs or can raise issues on pieces of code that it thinks is faulty
# CODE SMELLS
Code smells are the charateristics of a code that indicates that there migh be a problem caused by the code in the future
But smellls are not necessarilyu bad, sometimes they are how a functionality works and there is nothing that be done about it.(kind of like the technical depth)
# SECURITY VULNERABILITY
it can detct security issues that a code may face 
Eg. if a dev. forgets to close an open a SQL database OR if important details like username and password have been direclty written in the code.
